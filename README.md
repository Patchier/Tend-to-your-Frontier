# Tend To Your Frontier: A Fallout Experience 

March 25th, 2021 - Full Install: ~60GB.

## OVERVIEW

This ReadMe is designed to help you with installing and beginning your adventures in the Frontier, alongside a few new quests.

## GOALS

-  Install and make minor configuration to Fallout: New Vegas.

-  Install and get started with the Frontier experience you deserve!

## SPECIFICATIONS

- This list does not have any specific MCM tweaks, but it DOES have an extra step during the installation phase. Be sure to follow ALL instructions.

## First off, you will need:

-   A clean, fresh, and LEGAL GOG or Steam installation of Fallout: New Vegas w/ all DLCs

-   60GB free to install the list itself

## Install Fallout: New Vegas

- This part is self-explanatory. You'll want to go to the installation of the game, and remove all files present in the install folder (For example, steamapps/common/Fallout New Vegas) AND the Documents folder (Documents/My Games/FalloutNV)

- Once done, go ahead and re-install it. This ensures that any installs you have will be totally clean, which is important for the next steps. 

- While you're here, run the game once, and after the launcher has detected your graphics settings, you may close out of it. We just needed those initial INIs to be created. They will be superceded by the ones in my modlist.

Install Tend To Your Frontier via Wabbajack
-----------------------------------------

1.  Simply open the Wabbajack UI, which can be acquired from here if you don't already have it: <https://www.wabbajack.org/#/>. 

2.  Once you've installed Wabbajack, or if you already have it, open it up and choose "Browse Modists". 

3.  From there, you will download "Tend To Your Frontier" by clicking the little down arrow. 

4.  After that, you will choose an installation folder (I recommend something like "D:/Tend To Your Frontier", substituting D: for any drive available.) This CANNOT be where Wabbajack.exe is located, nor your Fallout New Vegas folder.

5.  Downloads will auto-populate for you, but you can change that location if you so choose. 

6.  From there, just click the "play" button and let it do the rest. If you do not have Nexus Premium, you will have to follow along to the manual download prompts.

7. Once the list has finished installing, open the folder you installed it to, and proceed to the "Game Folder Files" folder. 

8. Copy the items inside of the Game Folder Files folder to your Fallout: New Vegas installation location. (NOTE: NOT THE FOLDER ITSELF, JUST WHAT'S IN IT.)

9. Once the files are copied over, run the FalloutNVpatch.exe. This will patch your New Vegas exe to be Large Address Aware, letting you enjoy the list with a severely decreased risk of crashing.

10. IMPORTANT: IF YOU'RE USING GOG, DELETE THE FNV-Lang.esp PLUGIN. THIS IS UNNECESSARY. 

## Starting the game

Once you've finished installing the modlist, simply navigate to your installation folder for the modlist, open ModOrganizer.exe, and launch it via the New Vegas option, which should be selected for you. If not, simply choose it from the drop-down and click "run". 

## Regarding the Frontier quick-start

- As of the writing of this section, choosing the quick-start will enable to to place skill points anywhere you choose, up to the level of points you would have had at that time. However, perks only come in the form of presets. ONLY choose quick-start if you are okay with not being able to choose your perks up to level 12/15/20! Also, should you choose this, after about 5-6 in-game hours, an NCR scout will appear and give you a pamphlet detailing their cause. Following this, you will be able to fast-travel to their camp. AS OF THIS UPDATE, DO NOT CHOOSE THE LEGION START. IT WILL BREAK LEGION MAIN QUESTS! YOU WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THE LEGION IN THE FRONTIER!


## Mods to be aware of

- lstewieai Tweaks - This mod makes some engine-level tweaks and fixes to the game. Be sure to check out the INI right below it to see the changes!

- The Frontier - What the whole list is built around. If you're downloading this, you already know what it is. If not, you'll soon find out. 

- The Living Desert - This mod adds new patrols, NPCs, and other things to the Mojave to make the world feel much more alive. 

- Functional Post Game Ending - This mod allows you to continue after the game has ended, and actually SEE your choices reflected in the world. 

- Main Quest Tweaks - This makes a few small changes to a couple of areas in the game. For example, you may now start I Fought The Law for the NCR after completing Ghost Town Gunfight, letting you avoid working with the Powder Gangers at all.
