# Tend To Your Frontier: A Fallout Experience 

January 16th, 2021 - Full Install: ~67GB.

## OVERVIEW

This ReadMe is designed to help you with installing and beginning your adventures in the Frontier. 

## GOALS

-  Install and make minor configuration to Fallout: New Vegas.

-  Install and get started with the Frontier experience you deserve!

## SPECIFICATIONS

- This list only has one minor MCM tweak, so be sure you pay attention!

## First off, you will need:

-   A clean, fresh, and LEGAL Steam installation of Fallout: New Vegas w/ all DLCs

-   67GB free to install the list itself

## Install Fallout: New Vegas

- This part is self-explanatory. You'll want to go to the installation of the game, and remove all files present in the install folder (For example, steamapps/common/Fallout New Vegas)

- Once done, go ahead and re-install it. This ensures that any installs you have will be totally clean, which is important for the next steps. 

- While you're here, run the game once, and choose whatever graphics settings you desire. However, be sure to go to "Advanced", then "Shadows", and disable them. They don't add much, and it'll save you on performance. 

Install Tend To Your Frontier via Wabbajack
-----------------------------------------

1.  Simply open the Wabbajack UI, which can be acquired from here if you don't already have it: <https://www.wabbajack.org/#/>. 

2.  Once you've installed Wabbajack, or if you already have it, open it up and choose "Browse Modists". 

3.  From there, you will download "Tend To Your Frontier" by clicking the little down arrow. 

4.  After that, you will choose an installation folder (I recommend something like "D:/Tend To Your Frontier", substituting D: for any drive available.) This CANNOT be where Wabbajack.exe is located, nor your Fallout New Vegas folder.

5.  Downloads will auto-populate for you, but you can change that location if you so choose. 

6.  From there, just click the "play" button and let it do the rest.

## Starting the game

Once you've finished installing the modlist, simply navigate to your installation folder for the modlist, open ModOrganizer.exe, and launch it via the New Vegas option, which should be selected for you. If not, simply choose it from the drop-down and click "run". 

# Necessary MCM Tweak

- Pause the game when you get a change, and choose Mod Configuration.

- Go to Enhanced Item Info, and disable the option to show the Value/Weight. This is already handled by VUI+.

## Mods to be aware of

- lstewieai Tweaks - This mod makes some engine-level tweaks and fixes to the game. Be sure to check out the INI right below it to see the changes!

- The Frontier - What the whole list is built around. If you're downloading this, you already know what it is. If not, you'll soon find out. 

- MoreMojave - This mod is brand new to me, and adds a lot of new locations and enemies to the game. Be careful when exploring the more remote regions...

- Functional Post Game Ending - This mod allows you to continue after the game has ended, and actually SEE your choices reflected in the world. 

- Ludark's Alternative QuickStart for The Frontier - An alternative to the normal QuickStart for the Frontier. BE SURE TO DISABLE THIS IF DOING A LEGION PLAYTHROUGH!
